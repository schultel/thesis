Although the first conclusive observation of neutrino oscillations was made not
even twenty years ago, this phenomenon of neutrinos changing their flavour when
travelling macroscopic distances has been one of the major areas of research in
particle physics and astrophysics ever since. Up to now, it is the only
manifestation of so-called ``physics beyond the standard model'' that has been
confirmed experimentally. During the past two decades, many dedicated
experiments have mapped out the parameters characterising neutrino oscillations
in great detail, leaving only two parameters to be determined.

One of these parameters is the so-called neutrino mass hierarchy. It refers to
the sign of another parameter, one of the two independent mass splittings,
whose absolute value has already been measured.

Using the settings described in the previous section, the Fisher matrix for
PINGU can now be constructed with \papa. The full, statistical, and systematic
errors are for all parameters are listed in Tab.~\ref{tab:baseline_results} for
a nominal PINGU lifetime of three years. The parameters are ordered after their
\emph{impact} on the mass hierarchy parameter $h$, which is defined as the
square of their correlation coefficient $c_{ih}$ (\ref{eqn:corr_coeff}) with
$h$. Note that for the baseline settings, the systematic parameter
$s_\mathrm{PID}$ has been excluded as it is fully degenerate with $n_{\aeff}$:
since the PID decision is binary, no channel of unidentified events exists and
hence both parameters just evenly increase the overall number of events,
effectively.

From the first line of Tab.~\ref{tab:baseline_results}, one can read off the
expected significance of PINGU's mass hierarchy measurement by inverting the
full error (see Sec.~\ref{sec:fisher_hierarchy}). This gives an expected
significance of 2.9\,$\sigma$ after three years. Looking at the statistical
error alone, this value increases to 4.3\,$\sigma$, emphasising the important
role systematic parameters are playing in the determination of the mass
hierarchy.

Treating the track and cascade channels separately, the expected significances
are 1.9\,$\sigma$ with and 3.0\,$\sigma$ without systematics for the cascade
and 1.3\,$\sigma$ (3.1\,$\sigma$) for the track channel,
respectively\footnote{The full error listings corresponding to
Tab.~\ref{tab:baseline_results} can be found in
App.~\ref{app:fisher_baseline}}. Although the purely statistical significances
are comparable, when taking systematics into account the significance for the
cascades remains much higher than the track significance. 
The reason for this becomes obvious when looking at the \delchi distributions 
for both channels in Fig.~\ref{fig:akhmedov_baseline}. In the track channel, 
there are three distinct regions driving the expected significance. These 
regions are separated only by small margins and have alternating sign, while in 
the cascade channel most of the significance comes from one contiguous region. 
Together with the fact that the cascade channel has roughly three times higher 
event statistics than the track channel---62,000 vs.\ 22,000 neutrino events 
per year---this makes the cascade channel much more robust against the impact 
of systematic parameters.

In Fig.~\ref{fig:sigma_vs_time}, the significances for the individual channels 
and for their combination are shown as a function of time. The purely 
statistical significance is plotted as well, exhibiting a scaling with the 
square root of the lifetime as one would expect for a counting experiment where 
the relative error is proportional to $1/\sqrt{N}$. The actual significances 
including systematics increase much slower with time as a part of the 
accumulating statistics has to be ``spent'' in order to better constrain the 
systematic parameters. However the combined analysis of the two channels still 
gives a much higher sensitivity than simply adding the two individual channels 
in quadrature as one would do for two completely unrelated measurements of the 
same quantity. E.\,g.\ for a lifetime of three years as above, the quadratic 
sum of the track and cascade significances is $\sqrt{(1.3\,\sigma)^2 + 
(1.9\,\sigma)^2} \approx 2.3\,\sigma$, considerably lower than the 
2.9\,$\sigma$ for the combined analysis.

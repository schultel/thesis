\section{Effects of Advanced Optical Modules}
\label{sec:om_effects}
%==============================================================================

In Sec.~\ref{sec:Gen2DOM}, two different concepts to substantially improve the 
optical modules have been introduced, prototypes of both are supposed to be 
deployed in PINGU: the mDOM that has several small PMTs instead of a single 
large one, and the WOM, where the effective area of a single small PMT is 
enhanced drastically by passive components. In this chapter, we will model 
PINGU as it was completely built from these next-generation optical modules and 
analyse the effect this has on the experiment's outcome.
